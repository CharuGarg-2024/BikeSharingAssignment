## General Info

- Problem Statement
> A bike-sharing system offers bikes for short-term use, either for a fee or free of charge. Users can borrow a bike from a computer-controlled "dock" by entering payment information, and the system unlocks the bike. The bike can then be returned to any dock within the same system.

BoomBikes, a US bike-sharing provider, has experienced significant revenue declines due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The company is struggling to sustain itself in the current market conditions. To address this, BoomBikes aims to develop a strategic business plan to boost revenue once the lockdown ends and the economy recovers.

BoomBikes seeks to understand the demand for shared bikes post-quarantine. They plan to prepare for the increased demand and differentiate themselves from competitors to achieve substantial profits. To achieve this, they have hired a consulting firm to analyze the factors influencing the demand for shared bikes in the American market. Specifically, they want to identify:

Significant variables in predicting the demand for shared bikes.

How well these variables explain bike demand.

Using data from meteorological surveys and people's habits, the service provider has compiled a large dataset on daily bike demand across the American market.

- Objective
Our task is to model the demand for shared bikes using the available independent variables. This model will help management understand how demand varies with different features, allowing them to adjust their business strategy to meet demand levels and customer expectations. Additionally, the model will provide insights into the demand dynamics of a new market.



## Conclusions
1. The model shows good performance on both the training and test sets.

2. The residual plot indicates homoscedasticity, suggesting that the model's assumptions are met.

3. The coefficients and the equation of the best fit line provide insights into the relationship between the features and the target variable.

4. The R-squared and Adjusted R-squared values are consistent between the training and test sets, indicating that the model generalizes well to unseen data.


## Recommendations
1. Promote bike rentals during warmer months and working days to capitalize on higher demand.

2. Plan targeted marketing campaigns for winter and weekends to attract more customers.

3. Monitor weather conditions to anticipate demand and adjust bike availability accordingly.

4. Offer special discounts during low-demand months like December and July to boost rentals.

5. Regularly update the model with new data to maintain accuracy and relevance.
